# map-web-dev

 
This is where a mapofpi.html like an about.html page designed with the following in mind
It should contain all the key search strings embedded within it to enable mapofpi to be top of a Google search result screen
Once they arrive to this landing about us page it will direct them to a few options
Also encouraging the user to access the app using a button on the page as a pioneer
If not already a Pioneer encouraging the user to join Pi Network

A user-friendly information post about Map of Pi perhaps dynamically from Facebook
it could also encourage users to like/follow/share our Map of Pi Facebook page
Encourage them to facilitate the friends to also do so

Developers are encouraged to join the Map of Pi!
